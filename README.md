## Define the Data Pipeline
Let's say we want to create a data pipeline that processes log files from our web server and stores them in Amazon S3. Our pipeline will consist of the following steps:
- Retrieve log files from the web server.
- Parse log files to extract relevant information.
- Transform the data into a desired format.
- Store the transformed data in Amazon S3.

## Choose a Serverless Platform
For our pipeline, we'll use AWS Lambda, a popular serverless computing platform. Lambda allows us to run code in response to events, without the need to manage servers.

## Set Up Data Storage
We'll use Amazon S3 to store our log files and the transformed data. S3 provides scalable and durable object storage that is easy to integrate with other AWS services.

## Configure Data Transformation
We'll use Python to write our data transformation code. We can create a Lambda function that will be triggered when new log files are uploaded to S3. This function will read the log files, parse them, and transform the data into a desired format. We can use the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to interact with S3 and other AWS services.

## Configure Trigger and Workflow
To trigger our Lambda function when new log files are uploaded to S3, we'll use an S3 event notification. We can configure S3 to send a notification to our Lambda function whenever a new log file is uploaded to a specific S3 bucket. We can also configure our Lambda function to store the transformed data in another S3 bucket.

## Conclusion:
In this example, we used AWS Lambda to create a serverless data engineering pipeline that processes log files and stores the transformed data in Amazon S3. With Lambda, we were able to build a scalable, cost-effective, and reliable pipeline without the need to manage servers.
